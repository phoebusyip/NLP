## To use the website:
Enter videoID of any youtube channel, videoID is the code after {?v=}, ending before the next &
e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2RZOiUD5E0&t=48 -> video id is q2RZOiUD5E0

The app will display a review of the overall sentiment of the comments. Also features displaying most positive / negative comments.

-----

videoIDs to try:
- q2RZOiUD5E0
- J0soR73Jbio

Possible ideas:
Building a fine-grained, embedding-based model using Flair for improved analysis on ambiguity and context.
Do sentiment analysis on comments with more likes
Allow user to add words to help sentiment analysis (e.g. "juice" being a negative word in the fitness community, since it refers to steroids and "fake" content)
